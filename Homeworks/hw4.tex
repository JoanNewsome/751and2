\section{Residuals}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider a linear model $Y = X\beta + \delta \Delta + \epsilon$ where $\delta$ is a vector with a $1$ at position $i_0$ and $0$ elsewhere. Argue the following.
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item The $i_0$ residual is $0$ for this model.
\item The fitted value for $\beta$ using all of the data and this model is equivalent to that using only the data with the $i_0$ observation deleted.
\item Argue that the standardized Press residuals are a test statistic for $\Delta = 0$.
\end{enumerate}
\item Consider the residuals for the ordinary linear model. Derive their mean and variance. 
\item Carefully write up the proof that relates the Press residuals to the ordinary residuals. Derive the mean and variance/covariance of the Press residuals.
\item Prove the Sherman/Morrison/Woodburry theorem.
\item Prove that the hat matrix diagonals are between 0 and 1.
\item Why are the studentized residuals not exactly distributed as $t$ statistics?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Inference under incorrectly specified models}
For all of this section, let Model 1 be $Y = X_1 \beta_1 + \epsilon$ and Model 2 be $Y = X_1 \beta_1 + X_2 \beta_2 + \tilde \epsilon$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose that Model 1 is fit while Model 2 represents the actual truth. Give the bias and variance of $\beta_1$. Give the
expected value of $S^2$.
\item Suppose that Model 2 is fit while Model 1 is true. Give the bias and variance of the estimted $\beta$. Give the expected value of $S^2$. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Coding and data analysis exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the sleep data from the previous homework.
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item Consider the model fit from the previous homework. Write a program to grab the hat diagnals as well as use R's lm to obtain them directly. 
	Look at the influence of various data points.
\item Consider the model fit from the previous homework. Write a program to grab the residuals and Press residuals. Investigate these residuals
	in the context of this model.
\end{enumerate}
\item Consider the baseball data from the previous exercise.
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
\item Consider the model fit from the previous homework. Write a program to grab the hat diagnals as well as use R's lm to obtain them directly. 
	Look at the influence of various data points.
\item Consider the model fit from the previous homework. Write a program to grab the residuals and Press residuals. Investigate these residuals
	in the context of this model.
\end{enumerate}
\item Write a function that takes a $Y$ ($n\times 1$) an $X_1$ ($n \times 1$) and an $X_2$ ($n \times (p-1)$) and produces the partial regression
	plot of $e_{Y | X_2}$ by $e_{Y | X_2}$. 
\end{enumerate}
